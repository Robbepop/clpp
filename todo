Improvements & Bug fixes:
- Exceptions what() method is screwed and throws logical_error instead of providing information.
- Context Properties implementation uses ugly C-style casts in the get and set methods.
- Add convenience methods for context creation as Context::createBest() etc.
- Fix bug that detail::Object's retain and release methods can't check for errors via detail::error::handle method.
- Extend detail::error's global_info_map for all possible RetCodes.

Experimental:
- Use templates instead of ScalarType and FPType enums to coordinate calls for different OpenCL primitives.
  Problem with this approach may be that the methods parameter (template) must be known at compiler time
  instead of at runtime.
- Add several more ExceptionType's to this wrapper's API similar to JavaCL's exception type.
  Basically one ExceptionType for every error based RetCode. Would make RetCode storage in exception useless.
